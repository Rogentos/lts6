The purpose of the lts6 (Long Term Stable 6.x) overlay is to provide portage 
ebuilds based on Enterprise Linux 6.x source RPMs.

The goal is to develop a Gentoo-style installation that has long term 
stability and support.

As it stands now, Many of these ebuilds are significant downgrades, and would 
tend to destabilize a typical Gentoo installation unless applied selectively.  
A Stage 3+ base release will need to be developed for most of these ebuilds to 
make sense.
